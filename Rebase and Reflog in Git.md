### Git Rebase

**Git rebase** is a powerful feature that allows you to modify the base of a branch, effectively "replaying" its commits onto a new base. This is often used to maintain a cleaner and more linear project history.

Many developers prefer using **rebase** over the **merge** command because it simplifies the commit history, making it easier to follow. By rebasing, you can make changes without affecting the original branch, and you avoid creating unnecessary merge commits.

#### Merge Commits

A **merge commit** combines two or more branches into one. It contains all the changes from the branches being merged, which is crucial for preserving project history in complex workflows.

### Rebase Flow Example

Here’s a step-by-step guide to using Git rebase:

1. **Switch to the branch you want to rebase:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```

2. **Rebase the feature branch onto the main branch:**
   ```bash
   git rebase main
   ```

   This replays the commits from `feature-branch` on top of the latest changes in the `main` branch.

3. **Resolve any conflicts** that arise during the rebase process:
   - You can resolve conflicts manually using the VSCode merge tool.

4. **Add the resolved files and continue the rebase:**
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-files>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

> **Note:** Avoid using the `--force` option during rebase unless absolutely necessary, as it can lead to issues with project history. Using `--force` incorrectly can cause irreversible changes and confusion in the commit history.

### Git Reflog

**Git reflog** is a command that displays the history of all your Git references, including commits that might not be visible in the regular commit log. This can be incredibly useful for debugging or recovering lost commits.

#### Viewing Reflog

To see the history of your references:
```bash
git reflog
```

#### Find a Specific Commit

If you need to view a particular commit, use the commit hash:
```bash
git reflog <commit-hash>
```

#### Recovering Lost Commits

If you accidentally delete a branch or lose some changes, you can use reflog to recover them:

1. **Find the commit reference using reflog:**
   ```bash
   git reflog
   ```

2. **Reset your branch to the desired commit:**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard <commit-hash>
   ```

Alternatively, you can use:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD@{n}
```
Where `n` refers to the nth commit before the current one.
