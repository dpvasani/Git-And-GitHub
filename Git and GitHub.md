#### Understanding the Basics

Let’s begin with the fundamentals. Git is a version control system that enables you to track changes in your files and collaborate with others. It manages your code's history and facilitates merging changes from various branches. If terms like version control, branches, and merges are new to you, don’t worry! We’ll cover these concepts thoroughly in this tutorial.

### Differentiating Git and GitHub

While often used together, Git and GitHub serve different purposes:

- **Git** is a free and open-source version control system that tracks changes in files. It’s available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and can be installed directly on your computer.

- **GitHub** is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. It allows you to store and share your code online, making it a popular choice for developers to collaborate on projects. Although GitHub is not the only Git repository provider, it is one of the most widely used.

### A Brief Overview of Version Control Systems

Version control systems are crucial for managing code history. They enable you to track file changes and collaborate effectively. Think of version control like a game checkpoint; you can revert to any previous state, providing a safety net during development.

Before Git, developers relied on systems like SCCS (Source Code Control System), which were costly and not user-friendly. Git was designed to make version control more accessible and intuitive. Other common version control systems include Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.

### Learning Path

In this tutorial, we will cover the essentials of Git and GitHub, starting from the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced topics. You’ll also learn how to use these tools for collaboration and effective version control. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of Git and GitHub and be able to manage your code proficiently.

#### Our Journey Will Include:

1. Getting the basics
2. Daily usage
3. Identifying challenges
4. Problem-solving
5. Expanding knowledge

We'll begin with Git, and once you're comfortable with it, transitioning to GitHub will be straightforward.

### Installing Git

To install Git, you can either use the command line or download the installer from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Creating a GitHub Account

Next, create an account on GitHub. I’ll guide you through linking your GitHub account with your machine later in the tutorial. Note that you cannot push code to GitHub without setting up SSH key authentication; password authentication is no longer recommended or supported. We’ll cover SSH key setup in a subsequent section.

### Conclusion

In this section, we’ve introduced the basics of Git and GitHub, discussed installation procedures, and highlighted the significance of version control systems in software development. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to effectively manage your code using Git and GitHub.
